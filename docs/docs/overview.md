# Instant Analytics Overview

Instant Analytics GA4 brings full Google Analytics support to your Twig templates and automatic Craft Commerce 4 integration with Google Enhanced Ecommerce.

Instant Analytics GA4 also lets you track otherwise untrackable assets & events with Google Analytics, and eliminates the need for JavaScript tracking.

You donâ€™t need to include the typical Google Analytics script tag on your pages, instead Instant Analytics will send page views when your frontend templates are rendered via the officially supported [Google Analytics 4 Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4).

You can also track asset/media views in Google Analytics, either as PageViews or as Events. This lets you track otherwise untrackable things such as individual RSS feed accesses, images, PDF files, etc.

If you are using Craft Commerce 4, Instant Analytics will automatically send Google Analytics Enhanced eCommerce data to your Google Analytics account as items are added/removed from your cart, and orders are tracked as well.

Instant Analytics is implemented on the demo site [Brads for Men](https://bradsformen.com)
